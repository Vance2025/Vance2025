- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vance2025
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in writing technical documents and python coding.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and Spanish. I hope someday I could find a remote job that makes my life better. I am really curious about web3, however, at this time, I don't have enough knowledge to get into this industry.
